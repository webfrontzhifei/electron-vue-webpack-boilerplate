      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a full stack engineer. My most commonly used programming language is JavaScript Python C/C++.
        I know electron and vue sice last year, i create this repo for starting a project based on vue and electron quickly.
        When I create this repo, vue was still in it first released version, the second version was released recently, so i migrate it to vue2 and vue-router2.
        I like standardjs code style guide, you can change whatever you like.
        I refered some other boilerplate project, they are
        <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start">electron-quick-start</a>
        <a href="https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate">electron-react-boilerplate</a>
        You are allowd use this template any where, and don't need my permission.
